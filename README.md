# Diabetes-Detection-System

This project is a Machine Learning-based Diabetes Detection System that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. It helps in early risk assessment and awareness by using supervised learning techniques.

## Features
- User-friendly input interface (CLI / GUI / Web — mention based on your project)
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling for improved accuracy
- Trained Machine Learning model for prediction
- Visualizations to understand data distribution and correlations
- Model performance evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)

## Machine Learning Model Used
- Algorithm: (Example: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM / KNN)
- Dataset: PIMA Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle / UCI Repository *(mention your source)*
- Accuracy Achieved: **xx%** *(replace with your model accuracy)*

## Dataset Features

# This Diabetes Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a person using various health-related parameters such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, age, and more. The model analyzes the input medical data and provides a prediction indicating whether the person is at risk of diabetes. This project aims to assist in early detection and awareness, helping individuals monitor their health conditions more efficiently. However, this system is intended for educational and research purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.
